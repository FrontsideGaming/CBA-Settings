CBA Settings used by Fronside Gaming during Oficial Missions. This is configured to be all in advanced mode, and with most realistic setting possible in Arma 3.
Those settings include configuration for the following mods:

- ACE3
- ACEX
- ADV Medical (CPR & Splint).
- GRAD Trenches.
- ACRE2

## How to apply those settings to your mission

1. Copy the contents of [cba_settings.sqf](cba_settings.sqf) file.
2. On Eden Editor in Arma 3, Go to `Settings` and then `Addon Options` in the top toolbar.
3. Click on `IMPORT` button.
4. Done, all settings should be applied to the mission.

## Other files
This repository does also include some variations from the "Official" configuration. That where used to balance some missions or campaigns. Mostly all configurations are based on [cba_settings.sqf](cba_settings.sqf) settings, but some parameters may be changed or added in other missions.

## WARNING!!

Those settings are bound to the mission, the server should not override mission settings.
